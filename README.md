# Business Analyst Azure DevOps Training
Training for the IIBA (International Institute of Business Analysis) Tampa Meetup and available for anyone to utilize for free.  The training will be focused on learning how to utilize the Azure DevOps tool for creation of Epics/Features/User Stories and day to day functions in the life of a BA at work.  Additionally, there will be a module on writing User Stories and a lab scenario included for those new to the field. 

**Quick History of Azure DevOps:**
*All of the below products are essentially the same product over time and has been rebranded with different names for the same product.  The on-premises version means that the product is intalled onsite on a server within a company, the cloud version means the product is installed on a Microsoft server accessible anywhere.  The on-premise version, for example, TFS 2015 is a snapshot of how VSTS looked in 2015 and frozen and shipped to customers.  Since the cloud version is controlled by Microsoft, updates and bug fixes are pushed every 3 weeks to Azure DevOps. The current on-premises product available is Azure DevOps Server and the cloud version is Azure DevOps.  VSTS was rebranded to Azure DevOps in September 2018 and essentially has a UI refresh and some feature updates.*
