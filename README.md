Additionally, there will be a module on writing User Stories and a lab scenario included for those new to the field.

Intended audience: 
* Junior to Senior BAs who want to learn to use TFS/VSTS/Azure DevOps the tool
* Introduction to the BA field for those looking to start as a junior BA in the future and want to understand how to complete tasks using a tool and create basic Epics/Features/User Stories and manage backlogs

End goal of workshop:
* At the end of this workshop, attendees should feel able to work at a company utilizing Azure DevOps for their Backlog items and be able to complete day to day tasks to complete their job as a BA.  They will have a hands-on understanding of all relevant Work Item creation/management at a fine-grained and high level, reporting/dashboards, wiki, and useful extensions.  From the demo, they will be aware of additional customization options that are available in Azure DevOps for process workflows, custom rules, and custom work items. 

**Quick History of Azure DevOps:**
*All of the below products are essentially the same product over time and has been rebranded with different names for the same product.  The on-premises version means that the product is intalled onsite on a server within a company, the cloud version means the product is installed on a Microsoft server accessible anywhere.  The on-premise version, for example, TFS 2015 is a snapshot of how VSTS looked in 2015 and frozen and shipped to customers.  Since the cloud version is controlled by Microsoft, updates and bug fixes are pushed every 3 weeks to Azure DevOps. The current on-premises product available is Azure DevOps Server and the cloud version is Azure DevOps.  VSTS was rebranded to Azure DevOps in September 2018 and essentially has a UI refresh and some feature updates.*
